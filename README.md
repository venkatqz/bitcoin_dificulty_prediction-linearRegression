# Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts the mining difficulty of Bitcoin based on its network hash rate using simple linear regression. It uses historical hash rate and difficulty data to train a predictive model, visualize trends, and demonstrate how machine learning can be applied in the cryptocurrency domain.

## Features

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Bitcoin mining statistics.
- Outlier detection and removal using Z-score.
- Simple Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Data visualization using `matplotlib`.
- Predictive analysis for future mining difficulty.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `bitcoin.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
3. Run all cells to view analysis, regression results, and visualizations.

## Outcome

The project demonstrates a clear relationship between hash rate and mining difficulty, showing how higher computational power drives up mining difficulty. It also highlights the impact of outliers on prediction accuracy.
